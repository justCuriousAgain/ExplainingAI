		-	merry-go-round play water pump, tank walls for advertisement (now dubbed as 1st world solution for 3rd world problem. Hand pump was better)

		- head—by applying data and reason to altruistic acts—we can turn our good intentions into astonishingly good outcomes.
		
	- On Caring
		- brain is simply incapable of scaling the care up by a billion times
		- Our internal care-feelings are woefully inadequate for deciding how to act in a world with big problems.
		- Giving all of your money away is just not what you do with money. 
		- prominent altruists aren't the people who have a larger care-o-meter; they're the people who have learned not to trust their care-o-meters.
		- Courage isn't about being fearless; it's about being able to do the right thing even if you're afraid.
		- Found that seemingly obvious programs to improve education just weren’t working. 
		- De-worming (intestinal) helped as it reduced absenteeism. Cost-effective.

Week 2: 12 Jan 2022
	- Doing Good Better - Chapters 4 - 6 
		-	Diminishing returns also provides a powerful argument for focusing your altruistic efforts on people in poor countries rather than those in rich countries.
		- do far more good working in a poor country than in a rich one. 100x multiplier.
		- “Is this area neglected?” and trying to focus only on those areas that truly are neglected can be counterintuitive, but crucial.
		- If you don't become doctor, someone else will. Unless you are dramatically better than whoever will take the position, its better to earn in developed country and give to developing country. rather than trying to
maximize the direct impact you have with your job, you instead try to increase your earnings so you can donate more, improving people’s lives through your giving rather than your day-to-day work.
		- Thinking explicitly about expected value is important because humans are often terrible at assessing low-probability high-value events.
		- We just need to assess the chances of success and how good success would be if it happened.
