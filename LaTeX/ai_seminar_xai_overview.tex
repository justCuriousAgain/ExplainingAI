\begin{itemize}
\item As Machine Learning gets more prevalent, interpretation of results is needed by various stakeholders.
\item Regulatory compliance.
\item Insights into Black Box models.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Three Key Pillars of Explainable AI}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Reasonable AI}: The ability to understand the reasoning behind each individual prediction
\item {\bf Traceable AI}: The ability to trace prediction process from algorithm to data. 
\item {\bf Understandable AI}: The ability to fully understand the AI decision-making is based

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Benefits of Explainable AI}
To increase:
\begin{itemize}
\item Trust and social acceptance
\item Transparency and detection of bias
\item Robustness and reliability of model (as we would be consistent in results even after slight perturbations in inputs)
\item Better understanding of the model and domain.
\end{itemize}

But it may reveal the commercial secrets !!
